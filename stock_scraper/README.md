# StockScraper

This gem will scrape marketwatch.com for the S%P 500's most active stocks and return the them in a numbered list. Which you can then enter the number of the stock you would like more information on and it will provide a link that you can click and be directed to that stock's marketwatch page.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stock_scraper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
