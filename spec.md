# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application -- the cli.rb file adds interaction
- [X] Pull data from an external source -- stock_find.rb info is pulled marketwatch.com
- [X] Implement both list and detail views -- I have a class in the stock_find.rb that pulls the ticker and url for the active SP movers that lists each ticker on app start up then will provide the url when the user asks for more information
